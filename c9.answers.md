> “How can I set up MySQL on my Ubuntu machine which I am connecting to through Cloud9?”  

1. We would like to ask you to write a short piece of documentation on how to setup a MySQL instance on a Ubuntu machine. It is entirely up to you how you write the docs, but keep in mind that it needs to be helpful, friendly and easy to understand.
2.  What would be your communication strategy to notify other users of the update to our docs?

1. *Cloud9 Ubuntu machines come with a rich set of pre-installed software including [MySql 5.5](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/index.html), so it is available out-of-the-box in your workspace. You can manage MySql instance by running the `mysql-ctl` utility from [the terminal](https://docs.c9.io/terminal.html):*  
 - `$ mysql-ctl start` *- starts the MySql instance*
 - `$ mysql-ctl stop`  *- stops the MySql instance*
 - `$ mysql-ctl cli`   *- runs the MySql [command-line tool](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysql.html)*
2. I would use the open-source communication strategy:
 - Everyone can post the change request and watch for the updates
 - Everyone can contribute by using the pull requests
 - The releases notifications including the links to the fixed issues and newly added features are spread by using the blog posts and newsletters.

> “Since yesterday I am experiencing extremely slow terminal performance, what is going on? This is really annoying and I am close to leaving Cloud9 for another IDE”



1. Describe the steps you would take to find out the cause of the issue. (N.B.: You have full access to the cloud9 production systems)
2. The issue is not caused by the user, but by an issue in our infrastructure. Write up a response which you would define as a great response trying to build a relationship with that user. 
3. Define an operations strategy how you handle these issues from a customer relation perspective. This means that you should define a very clear procedure for our support team so that you always know how we should react in such cases.
