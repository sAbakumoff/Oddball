> “How can I set up MySQL on my Ubuntu machine which I am connecting to through Cloud9?”  

1. We would like to ask you to write a short piece of documentation on how to setup a MySQL instance on a Ubuntu machine. It is entirely up to you how you write the docs, but keep in mind that it needs to be helpful, friendly and easy to understand.
2.  What would be your communication strategy to notify other users of the update to our docs?

## Answers  


1. *Cloud9 Ubuntu machines come with a rich set of pre-installed software including [MySql 5.5](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/index.html), so it is available out-of-the-box in your workspace. You can manage MySql instance by running the `mysql-ctl` utility from [the terminal](https://docs.c9.io/terminal.html):*  
 - `$ mysql-ctl start` *- starts the MySql instance*
 - `$ mysql-ctl stop`  *- stops the MySql instance*
 - `$ mysql-ctl cli`   *- runs the MySql [command-line tool](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysql.html)*
2. I would use the open-source communication strategy:
 - Everyone can post the change request and watch for the updates
 - Everyone can contribute by using the pull requests
 - The releases notifications including the links to the fixed issues and newly added features are spread by using the blog posts and newsletters. 

# Operations #
> “Since yesterday I am experiencing extremely slow terminal performance, what is going on? This is really annoying and I am close to leaving Cloud9 for another IDE”



1. Describe the steps you would take to find out the cause of the issue. (N.B.: You have full access to the cloud9 production systems)
2. The issue is not caused by the user, but by an issue in our infrastructure. Write up a response which you would define as a great response trying to build a relationship with that user. 
3. Define an operations strategy how you handle these issues from a customer relation perspective. This means that you should define a very clear procedure for our support team so that you always know how we should react in such cases.

1. To be honest I didn't find any satisfied reply. I never dealt with diagnosing the problem with the large scale systems and it's quite hard to figure out the steps I would take especially if I don't know the Cloud9 IDE architecture details. I hoped that this is one of the things that I can learn from the team. 
2. *Dear {Customer Name},  
Thank you for letting us know about the problem you've faced. Customers happiness is our top priority and it's important for us to be aware of the situations when you are not pleased with your Cloud9 IDE experience.  
We are sorry for the inconvenience caused by the slow terminal performance. We strive to provide the streamlined access to a workspace environment but sometimes unexpected events prevent us to do so. Our team is diligently working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and ensure that it will not happen again. I will keep you informed on the progress in this matter.  
If you require additional information, please, let me know and I will be happy to help.  
Sincerely,

1. Here are the steps from a customer relation perspective:
  2. Figure out whether the problem is global and all the customers face the same issue. If it is then make sure that everyone knows about the global outage by sending out the announcement on the web-site.
  3. If the problem is specific to the complaining customer then check out whether the issue is in her side, for example it is caused by the slow internet connection. If it is then update the customer accordingly, make it absolutely clear that it's not our fault, but provide her with useful tips if it's possible. 
  4. If the problem is in our infrastructure then open the change request for development or operation team by providing all the necessary details and inform the customer, see the example of reply above.
   
  
# New Feature 

> “Cloud9 is awesome but before I upgrade to premium I really need a plugin for selecting colors. Please implement this, it would make me super happy”

1. Write a reply which takes this as feedback we would like to implement.
2. Write a reply which lets the user know that we are not going to implement this idea.
3. Come up with a process on how to handle these requests in the support team so that we don’t overflow the product team with new feature requests.
4. Development task

# Data Loss


> “What the hell happened? I lost two weeks of work for an unknown reason and now need to do everything again. Can you assist and recover this? I am very worried that Cloud9 is not taking my data seriously”


1. Write a reply which communicates that we have a backup of the users data and will restore this. Keep in mind that you need to build trust so try and take this into the response.
2. We have lost the user’s data. Somehow a bug in our backup worker prevented a backup to be made and this wasn’t detected by our monitoring solution. You discover this while trying to restore the backup. Write a reply to the user, aiming to keep the user as a cloud9 customer.
3. Describe the different aspects which come into play when it comes to data security and write up a data security communication strategy which we can follow (for instance including our commitment to our users data integrity)

3. As far as I know the basic principles in the data security are integrity, confidentiality and availability. The communication strategy may include a few statements:
	1. We are committed to keeping the data safe and secure
	2. We will never share, resell or manipulate the data
	3. We are using the best practices to ensure the data-safety rules
	4. We are prepared for emergency situations
